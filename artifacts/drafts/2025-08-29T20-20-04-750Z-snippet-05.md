## 5) Procedure (strict order)
1. **Validate** presence of required artifacts.
2. **Run Gates** (γ, chain, cost, CI, TRACE schema, hygiene/security).
3. If any gate fails → emit **Recovery Plan** and STOP.
4. **Score** with the rubric; include short justifications per dimension.
5. **Verdict**: `APPROVE_PR` or `REQUEST_CHANGES`.
6. **Next tiny step** (even on approve): one optional improvement with ≤50 LOC impact.
